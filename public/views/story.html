        <h1>OUR STORY</h1>
        <p>We are a small but very close family. The life story of our daughter Keira, who passed away from cancer 3
          years ago, continues to touch our hearts and was the inspiration behind our business. Keira found
          such joy in nature and in spending time outdoors and she loved nothing more than <span>“getting out and
          making her own tracks”.</span></p>
        <p>Since her passing we’ve come to realize that life is too short and that we need to enjoy living! Spending
          time in the open air can be healing to the soul and helps us appreciate nature’s simple beauties and many
          miracles. Through our product line we hope to inspire you to <span>“get out and make your own tracks”</span>,
          too – whether it be in the great outdoors, in your own backyard or even in your daily life.</p>
        <p>You'll love our hammocks! In a comparative study we have purchased many other hammocks from top name brands.
          Our hammocks are made of a higher quality, light weight fabric, offer greater durability
          and are the most affordable on the market. Plus we guarantee our products. If for any reason you are
          not 100% satisfied or happy with your purchase we will gladly refund or exchange your order.</p>
        <!-- <p>Let us help you <span>"Get Out and Make Your Own Tracks"</span>, too!</p> -->
